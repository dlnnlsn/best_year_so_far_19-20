\section{Problem 1, Bulgaria Round 3, 1975}
Let $n$ be an odd natural number and $a_1$, $a_2$,..., $a_n$ a permutation of the numbers $1$, $2$,...,$n$. 

Show that the value $(a_1-1)*(a_2-2)*...(a_n-n)$ is an even number.

\section{Problem 1, Spanish MO, 1995}
	Consider all sets $A$ of one hundred different natural numbers with the property
	that any three elements $a$,$b$,$c \in A$ (not necessarily different) are the sides of
	a non-obtuse triangle. Denote by $S(A)$ the sum of the perimeters of all such
	triangles. Compute the smallest possible value of $S(A)$.


\section{Putnum 2002, A2}
Given any five points on a sphere, show that some four of them
must lie on a closed hemisphere.

\section{Putnum 2003, A1}
Let $n$ be a fixed positive integer. How many ways are there to write  $n$
as a sum of positive integers,  
\[
n = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_k,
\]
with  $k$  an
arbitrary positive integer and  $a_1 \le a_2 \le \cdots \le a_k \le a_1  + 1$?
For example, with $n=4$ there are four ways: 4, 2+2, 1+1+2, 1+1+1+1.
