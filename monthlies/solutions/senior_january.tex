\item % PAMO Shortlist 2019
{\itshape On the board, we write the integers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 2019$.
At each minute, we pick two numbers on the board $a$ and $b$, erase them, and write down the number $s(a + b)$ instead where $s(n)$ denotes the sum of the digits of the integer $n$.
Let $N$ be the last number remaining on the board.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Is it possible that $N = 19$?
	\item Is it possible that $N = 15$?
\end{enumerate}}
Problem Solution.

\item % Baltic Way 2009 Problem 8
{\itshape For which positive integers $n$ is it possible to divide the set of numbers $\{n, n+1, n+2, \dotsc, n+8\}$ into two disjoint sets $A$ and $B$ such that the product of the numbers in $A$ is equal to the product of the numbers in $B$?}

{\itshape Let $M$ be a positive integer, and let $S$ denote the set of finite sequences of positive integers less than or equal to $M$, including the empty sequence of length zero, which we denote as $\mathbf{0}$.
Also, for a sequence $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \dotsc, x_n)$ let $\overline{\mathbf{x}}$ denote the reverse sequence $\overline{\mathbf{x}} = (x_n, x_{n-1}, \dotsc, x_1)$.

Define a function $d$ from $S$ to the integers as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item $d(\mathbf{0}) = 0$.
\item If $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \dotsc, x_n)$ is a sequence of positive length, let $m$ be the largest integer such that $x_1 +x_2 +\dotsb +x_m \leq M$, and let $\mathbf{x}'$ denote the rest of the sequence: $\mathbf{x}' = (x_{m+1}, \dotsc, x_n)$.
Then $d(\mathbf{x}) = 1 +d(\mathbf{x}')$.
\end{itemize}
Show that $d(\mathbf{x}) = d(\overline{\mathbf{x}})$.}

\item
{\itshape Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral with its diagonals intersecting at $E$.
Let $M$ be the midpoint of $AB$.
Suppose that $ME$ is perpendicular to $CD$.
Show that either $AC$ is perpendicular to $BD$ or $AB$ is parallel to $CD$.}



\medskip
\item % IMO 2008 Shortlist C3
{\itshape We have done it! We have planted an infinite number of trees on the vertices of an infinite regular grid, one for each vertex. Let $T$ be a positive integer. 
We define a {\itshape T-forest} as a set of trees such that for any two trees in the $T$-forest, there exists another tree planted in the grid such that the area of the triangle with these three trees as vertices is $T$.

What is the smallest $T$ such that our $T$-forest has more than $200$ trees?}



\medskip
\item % IMO 2009 Shortlist N4
{\itshape Given a series $t_1, t_2, \dotsc, t_n$ such that 
\[ t_{k + 1} = \frac{t_k^2 + 1}{t_{k-1} + 1} - 1 \quad \forall \ k \in \{2, 3, \dots, n-1\}. \]
For which $n \in \mathbb{N}$ does there exist a $t_1$ and $t_2$ such that $t_i \in \mathbb{N}$ for all $i \in \{1, 2, 3, \dotsc, n\}$?}



\medskip
\item % Modified Iran TST 2018 Q6
{\itshape Let $AC$ and $BD$ be two chords of a circle $\Gamma$ that intersect at $X$ in the interior of $\Gamma$.
Let $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ be circles that are mutually tangent at $X$ and are tangent to $\Gamma$ at $P$ and $Q$.
Let $\omega$ be a circle tangent to $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ at $X$ that intersects the chords $AB$ and $CD$ at $M$ and $N$ respectively.
Prove that
\[
	\frac{MP}{MQ} = \frac{NP}{NQ} \implies \angle AXM = \angle DXN.
\]}



\medskip
\item % The Andrew and The Dylan
{\itshape Let $n$ be a positive integer greater than $1$, and consider a circle of radius $1$ in which is inscribed a regular $n$-gon $P$ with vertices labelled from $1$ to $n$ in that order.
Consider the set $S$ of positive divisors of $n$, and the convex polygon $G$ formed by the points of $P$ with labels in $S$.
If the area of $G$ is denoted by $|G|$, show that
\[ 
	|G| < \frac{3}{2}.
\]}
