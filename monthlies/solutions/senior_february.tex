We will first show that $H$ lies on the circumcircle of $\triangle BCD$ 
\\ Since $AB = BD$ and $BH \perp AD$, then $AH$ bisects $AD$, then $AH = HD \implies \angle HAD = \angle HDA$. Now $\angle HBC = 90^{\circ} - \angle ACB = \angle HAC$ and so $\angle HBC = \angle HDA$ and so $BHDC$ is cyclic. 
\\ Next we show that $A$, $H$ and $E$ are collinear
\\It is equivalent to to show that $\angle HED = \angle AED$. 
\\ $\angle HED = \angle HBD$ since $BHDC$ is cyclic. 
\\ Also, $\angle AED = \frac{\angle ABD}{2} = \angle HBD$ and so $A$, $H$ and $E$ are collinear. 
\\ Since $\angle ABF = \angle AEF$, then $ABEF$ is cyclic and so $\angle HFD = \angle BAH = 90^{\circ} - \angle ABC = \angle HCB = \angle HDB \implies BD$ is tangent to the circumcircle of $ \triangle DHF$

{\itshape For any 4 points in $\mathbb{R}^3$, does there exist a plane such that the orthogonal projections of the points on the plane make up the vertices of a parallelogram?

}
Let $A,B,C,D$ be vectors from the origin to the $4$ respective points.
And let $p_U(v)$ denote the projection of $v$ onto $U$ for a plane $U$ that goes through the origin. It is well known that $p_U(v) + p_U(w) = p_U(v + w)$

We want to find a plane, $U$, such that the projections of $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ are a parallelogram. This is equivalent to
$p_U(A) - p_U(B) = p_U(D) - p_U(C)$

But by additivity of $p_U$ the above is equivalent to
$p_U(A - B + C - D) = 0$

Which means all we need is a plane $U$ through the origin that is perpendicular to $A - B + C - D$, which clearly exists.

In the case where $A - B + C - D = 0$, any plane $U$ would result in a parallelogram.

{\itshape Find all positive integers $n$ that can be written in the form:
$$n = \left\lfloor m + \sqrt{m} + \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor$$
where $m$ is also a positive integer.}

All positive integers except those that are perfect squares can be written in this form. 
\\ Let $k^{2} \leq m < (k+1)^{2}$ and let $m = k^{2} + x$ where $x \in \{0,1,...,2k\}$
\\ Now consider when $x=\{0,1,2,...,k\}$, then $m \leq k^{2} + k \implies m < k^{2} + k + \frac{1}{4} = (k+\frac{1}{2})^{2}$ and so $\sqrt{m} < k + \frac{1}{2}$
Then $n = \left\lfloor m + \sqrt{m} + \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor = m + \left\lfloor  \sqrt{m} + \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor = m + k$. Taking all possible values for $m$ gives that the numbers $n$ that can be formed are $\{k^{2}+k, k^{2}+k+1,..., k^{2}+2k\}$ $\forall k \in \mathbb{N}$
\\ Then consider when $x=\{k+1,k+2,,...,2k\}$, then $m > k^{2} + k \implies m > k^{2} + k + \frac{1}{4} = (k+\frac{1}{2})^{2}$ and so $\sqrt{m} > k + \frac{1}{2}$
Then $n = \left\lfloor m + \sqrt{m} + \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor = m + \left\lfloor  \sqrt{m} + \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor = m + k + 1$. Taking possible values for $m$ gives that the numbers $n$ that can be formed are $\{k^{2}+2k+2, k^{2}+2k+3,..., k^{2}+3k+1\}$ $\forall k \in \mathbb{N}$ Letting $k \to k-1$ here generates the set $\{k^{2}, k^{2}+1,...,k^{2}+k\}$. 
\\ In total we can produce numbers only in the form $\{k^{2}+1, k^{2}+2,..., k^{2}+2k\}$ $\forall k \in \mathbb{N}$ which is clearly all the positive integers except the perfect squares.

{\itshape An $8 \times 8$ chessboard is divided into several regions by 13 straight lines. Can the lines be placed in such a way that each region contains at most 1 centre of the original 64 squares?}

Construct the centers of all $28$ outer edge squares, and connect the adjacent centers, resulting in the outline of a square with $28$ segments, $7$ per side. If, after the lines have been placed, there exists one of these segments which have not been crossed, it implies that these $2$ centers lie on the same region. 
Note that a line can pass through at most $2$ of these segments, meaning that there is at least $2$ segments which are uncrossed, resulting in two centers being on the same region.

{\itshape Show that there are only finitely many solutions $(x, y) \in \mathbb{N}^2$ to the equation
$$\sum_{i = 1}^{m} (x + i)^n = \sum_{i = 1}^{m} (y + i)^{2n}$$
where $m, n \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{1\}$ are given constants.}

By the Power-Mean Inequality, we have:
$$(\frac{(x + i)^n + (x + m + 1 - i)^n}{2})^{\frac{1}{n}} > x + \frac{m + 1}{2}$$
$$\implies \frac{(x + i)^n + (x + m + 1 - i)^n}{2} > (x + \frac{m + 1}{2})^n$$
$$\implies \sum_{i = 1}^{n} (x + i)^n > m(x + \frac{m + 1}{2})^n$$

Expanding the LHS gives:
$$\sum_{i = 1}^{m} (x + i)^n = mx^n + \frac{mn(m + 1)}{2}x^{n - 1} + O_1(x^{n - 2})$$

Similarly:

$$m(x + \frac{m + 2}{2})^n = mx^n + \frac{mn(m + 2)}{2}x^{n - 1} + O_2(x^{n - 2})$$

Since the coefficients of the second term will dominate the expression after subtracting the two, we have:

$$m(x + \frac{m + 2}{2})^n > \sum_{i = 1}^{m} (x + i)^n > m(x + \frac{m + 1}{2})^n ~\forall x > T$$

where $T$ is some sufficiently large real number. Following a similar process and replacing $n$ by $2n$ and $x$ by $y$, we get:

$$m(y + \frac{m + 2}{2})^{2n} > \sum_{i = 1}^{m} (y + i)^{2n} > m(y + \frac{m + 1}{2})^{2n} ~\forall y > K$$

where $K$ is some sufficiently large real number. Adding $1$ to $y$ yields:

$$m(y + \frac{m + 2}{2} + 1)^{2n} > \sum_{i = 1}^{m} (y + i + 1)^{2n} > m(y + \frac{m + 1}{2} + 1)^{2n} ~\forall y > K$$

Since $m$ is fixed, we can choose $y > K$ such that: 
$$y^2 + (m + 2)y + (\frac{m + 2}{2})^2 - \frac{m + 1}{2} > T$$

\item % Spain, Round 2, 1992
{\itshape In the land of Graphopia there are $n$ towns. Between some pairs of towns there are direct roads. The residents of these towns want to have mathematics tournaments. They've decided that in order to have a mathematics tournament they need to have $a$ participating towns. Further they decide that in order to have a tournament the connections between the towns involved must be symmetrical. That is either every pair of towns in a tournament are directly linked by a road or no pair is. 

As mathematics competitions are rightly adored by every member of Graphopia every grouping of $a$ towns that can hold a tournament holds one once a year (some towns may be in multiple groupings). However in some years new roads are built and old ones lost to the elements. If a group of $a$ towns find themselves able to put on a tournament they immediately do. If a tournament finds itself unallowable due to road connections, that tournament is regretfully discontinued. Prove that it is possible that one year poor Graphopia finds itself having less than $\binom{n}{a} $$2^{1-\binom{a}{2}}$ tournaments.
}


Let the towns be nodes of a connected graph. If there is a road between two towns, let the edge be coloured red, and blue if not.
Consider the sample-space, $\Omega$, of all possible colourings of the graph and note that each edge has equal frequency and therefor equal probability of being either red or blue for a randomly selected colouring.

Therefor a collection of $a$ towns has probability $2^{1-{{a}\choose{2}}}$ of being mono-coloured.

Let the number of competitions be denoted by ${X}$.

Note that the number of collections of $a$ towns is ${n}\choose{a}$

Now, by Linearity of Expectation: 

$\mathbb{E}({X}) = {{n}\choose{a}}\times2^{1-{{a}\choose{2}}}$

Ignoring the trivial case of $a=2$, since $X$ is discrete and there exists a colouring where $X>\mathbb{E}({X})$, namely the graph where all edges are blue, there must exist a colouring where $X$ is less than $\mathbb{E}({X})$.

\end{align*}

where $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Where does equality occur?}

Assume without loss of generality that $a \geq b \geq c$.
\\ We will first show that 
\begin{align} 
\frac{a^{n+1}}{a^{n+1}+b^{n}+c^{n}} \geq \frac{b^{n+1}}{a^{n}+b^{n+1}+c^{n}} \geq \frac{c^{n+1}}{a^{n}+b^{n}+c^{n+1}}
\end{align}
and 
\begin{align}
a^{n}+b^{n}+c^{n+1} \geq a^{n}+b^{n+1}+c^{n} \geq a^{n+1}+b^{n}+c^{n}
\end{align}
For the first inequality, we show the left side holds since the other part is done similarly.
\\ The left side is equivalent to
\begin{align*}
 a^{n+1}(a+c^{n}) \geq b^{n+1}(b+c^{n})
\end{align*}
which is true and so the first inequality holds. 
\\ To show that (2) is true, we again only consider the left side which is equivalent to 
\begin{align*}
b^{n}+c^{n+1} \geq b^{n+1}+c^{n}
\iff (\frac{b}{c})^{n} \geq \frac{1-c}{1-b}
\end{align*}
Now
\begin{align*}
\\a(b-c)&\geq 0 
\\ \iff (b-c)(1-(b+c))&\geq 0
\\ \iff b(1-b)&\geq c(1-c) 
\\ \iff \frac{b}{c} &\geq \frac{1-c}{1-b}
\\ \iff (\frac{b}{c})^{n} &\geq \frac{1-c}{1-b}
\end{align*}
and so (2) holds.
\\Now applying Chebyshev's inequality gives:
\begin{align*} 
\sum_{cyc}\frac{a^{n+2}}{a^{n+1}+b^{n}+c^{n}} &\geq \frac{a+b+c}{3}\sum_{cyc}\frac{a^{n+1}}{a^{n+1}+b^{n}+c^{n}} \\ &=\frac{1}{3}\sum_{cyc}\frac{a^{n+1}}{a^{n+1}+b^{n}+c^{n}}\frac{\sum_{cyc}(a^{n+1}+b^{n}+c^{n})}{\sum_{cyc}(a^{n+1}+b^{n}+c^{n})}\\
&\geq \frac{1}{3}(3\sum_{cyc}a^{n+1})\frac{1}{\sum_{cyc}a^{n+1}+2\sum_{cyc}a^{n}}\\
&\geq \sum_{cyc}a^{n+1}\frac{1}{\sum_{cyc}a^{n+1}+6\sum_{cyc}a^{n+1}}
\\&=\frac{1}{7}
\end{align*}
Equality holds when $a=b=c=\frac{1}{3}$.
