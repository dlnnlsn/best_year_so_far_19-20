Let $E_0,E_1,...,E_{n-2}$ be the set of shared edges in your stack, with $E_i$ being the edge that's shared between the $i^{th}$ and $i+1^{th}$ placed polygons, and with $E_0$ and $E_{n-2}$ being the bottom- and top-most edge respectively.

Note that the edges of a regular $p-gon$ are just rotated by an integer multiple of $\frac{360}{p}$ degrees, therefor edge $E_i$ is just $E_{i-1}$ rotated by some positive integer multiple $a_q < q$ of $\frac{360}{q}$, where $q$ is the number of sides of the polygon shared by $E_i$ and $E_{i-1}$. Let this multiple be called $q_i$ for $0<i<n-2$

Therefor the angle of inclination of $E_{n-2}$ is just some sum of these $q_i$ mod $180$. For $E_{n-2}$ to be perfectly flat, this value must equal $0$.

$\sum_{i=1}^{n-2} q_i \equiv_{180} 0 \Rightarrow {\sum_{i=3}^{n} \frac{a_i}{i} \equiv_{1} 0}$

Let $p$ be the largest prime less than or equal to $n$. Note that $\frac{a_p}{p} + \frac{a_i}{i}$ will always have a fractional part with denominator some multiple of $p$ unless $gcd(p,i) \neq 1$, meaning $i \geq 2p$, which by Bertrand's postulate implies that there exists some prime $q$ such that $p<q<2p$, which is a contradiction.

Therefor no $n$ exist to satisfy the condition in the question statement.
