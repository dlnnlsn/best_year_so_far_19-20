\item[1.] % 2015 Azerbaijan IMO TST, Q1
A set, $A=\{a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n\}$, of distinct, positive integers is called ``powerful'' if
$$\prod_{i \neq j}^{}a_j \mid a_i^{2020}$$ 

for all $i \in \{1, 2, \cdots, n\}$. Find all $n \ge 3$ such that there exists a ``powerful'' set containing exactly $n$ elements.

\item[2.] % All Russian Olympiad 2017, Grade 10, Q2 
Let $ABC$ be an acute angled isosceles triangle with $AB = AC$ and circumcentre $O$. Lines $BO$ and $CO$ intersect $AC$ and $AB$ at $D$ and $E$ respectively.
A straight line $l$ is drawn through $E$ parallel to $AC$. Prove that the line $l$ is tangent to the circumcircle of $\triangle DOC$.

\medskip
\item[3.] % 2017 Princeton University Maths Competition A4
Let the sequence $a_1$, $a_2$, $\cdots$ be defined by $a_n = 11a_{n - 1} - n$. Find the smallest possible value of $a_1$ such that $a_i > 0$ for all $i \in \mathbb{N}$.

\medskip
\item[4.] % China Southeast Math Olympiad 2014, Q2
There are $n \ge 4$ people at a fencing competition. Each player plays against every other player exactly once, and
there are no draws. The organisers decide that the competition is representative if they can find $4$ people: $a_1$,
$a_2$, $a_3$ and $a_4$, such that $a_i$ beats $a_j$ whenever $i < j$. Find the smallest value $n$ such that the
competition will always be representative.

\medskip
\item[5.] % 2011 Japan Mathematical Olympiad Finals Problem 5
Given some $4$ points in the plane, one can construct $4$ different triangles with vertices amongst the $4$ points. If the inscribed circles
of these $4$ triangles all have the same radius, show that the $4$ triangles are congruent.
