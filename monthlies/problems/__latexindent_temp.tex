\item[1.] % Silk Road Maths Competition, 2012
Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral with $AD \parallel BC$. Let $X$ be the midpoint of arc $AD$ that does not contain point $C$ and $P$ be a point on the tangent to the circle at $C$ such that $\angle CPX = 90 \si{\degree} $. Prove that $BC = 2 CP$.   


\medskip
\item[2.] % AoPS, 2020
For $n,m\in\mathbb{N}$ let $S_{n,m}$ be the set of all increasing integer sequences $x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{nm}$, where $0\leq x_i\leq nm$ and satisfying $n \mid x_{1} + x_{2} + \cdots +x_{nm}$. Prove that exactly half of the elements of $S_{n,m}$ have $x_{nm}=nm$.


\medskip
\item[3.] % IMC 2015, Day 1, Problem 2, Stephan Wagner
Let $B: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ be a function such that $B(n)$ is the number obtained by changing every $0$ in the binary expansion of $n$ to a $1$ and every $1$ to a $0$. Leading $0$'s are ignored in the binary expansion of $n$. Prove that for any positive integer $k$

$$\sum_{r=1}^{k} f(r) \le \frac{k^2}{4}$$

When does equality occur?


\medskip
\item[4.] % Iranian TST 2018, Day 2, Q4
Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $\angle BAC$ not being a right-angle. $BE$ and $CF$ are the altitudes of the triangle, and the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ meets $EF$ and $BC$ at $M$ and $N$ respecively. Furthermore, $P$ is a point satisfying $MP \perp EF$ and $NP \perp BC$. Prove that $AP$ bisects segment $BC$.


\medskip
\item[5.] % 1997 Romania TST, Day 1, Q3
There are $n$ points in the plane such that no three are collinear and the points do not all lie on the same circle. If $S$ is the set containing these $n$ points, find all functions $f : S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that all circles that have $m \ge 3$ points, $p_1$, $p_2$, $\dots$, $p_m$, in S satisfy

$$\sum_{i = 1}^{m} f(p_i) = 0.$$

\item[6.] % 2012 European Girlsâ€™ Mathematical Olympiad P8
A word is a collection of letters. Define a word to be $rhythmical$ if it can be written as the concatenation of $2$ or more identical words (for example, $hehehe$ and $fufufu$ are $rhythmical$, but $hahah$ and $hohohaha$ are not). A word is said to be $melodic$ if after swapping any two differing adjacent letters, the resulting word would be $rhythmical$. Find all $melodic$ words.

\item[8.] % Ralph, 2020
Let $f(n)$ be the number of pairs $(p, q)$ such that $p + q = n$ where both $p$ and $q$ are primes. Prove that
$$\sum_{k = 1}^{m} \frac{f(k)}{2^k} < 1$$
for all positive integers $m$.
