Two players write pluses or minuses in front of consecutive natural numbers $1, 2, 3, \dotsc$ and calculate the sum of all the numbers that have a sign in front of them.
This way, the first player starts with writing a sign in front of $1$, and this is his sum after the first move.
Then the second player writes a sign in front of $2$ and calculates the sum of the first two numbers with signs -- this is the sum after his first move.
After that the first player writes a sign in front of $3$ and calculates the sum of three numbers with signs, and so on.
When the sum becomes larger than $2019$ in absolute value, the game stops.
The player who made the last move loses.
Which player has a winning strategy?

We say that a set $S$ of integers is \emph{rootiful} if, for any positive integer $n$ and any $a_0, a_2, \dotsc, a_n \in S$, all integer roots of the polynomial $a_0 +a_1 x +\dotsb +a_n x^n$ are also in $S$.
Find all rootiful sets of integers that contain all numbers of the form $2^a-2^b$ for positive integers $a$ and $b$.

Let $ABCDE$ be a convex pentagon such that $\angle EDC \neq 2 \cdot \angle ADB$ and $CD = DE$.
Suppose that a point $P$ is located in the interior of the pentagon such that $AP = AE$ and $BP = BC$.
Prove that $P$ lies on the diagonal $CE$ if and only if
\[ \area{BCD} +\area{ADE} = \area{ABD} +\area{ABP}. \]
