\item % Austrian MO Q15, C
In the country of Oddland, there are stamps with values $1$ cent, $3$ cents, $5$ cents, etc., one type for each odd number.
the rules of Oddland Postal Services stipulate the following: for any two distinct values, the number of stamps of the higher value on an envelope must never exceed the number of stamps of the lower value.

In the country of Squareland, on the other hand, there are stamps with values $1$ cent, $4$ cents, $9$ cents, etc., one type for each square number.
Stamps can be combined in all possible ways in Squareland without additional rules.

Prove that for every positive integer $n$:
In Oddland and Squareland there are equally many ways to correctly place stamps of a total value $n$ cents on an envelope.
Rearranging the stamps on an envelope makes no difference.

Let $n$ be a positive integer greater than $1$, and consider a circle of radius $1$ in which is inscribed a regular $2n$-gon $P$ with vertices labelled from $1$ to $2n$ in that order.
Consider the set $S$ of positive divisors of $2n$, and the convex polygon $G$ formed by the points of $P$ with labels in $S$.
If the area of $G$ is denoted by $|G|$ and the number of elements of $S$ is denoted by $\tau(2n)$, show that
\[ \frac{1}{2} \parens{\sin\parens{\frac{\pi}{n}} +\cos\parens{\frac{\pi}{n}}} < |G| < \frac{\tau(2n)}{2} \sin\parens{\frac{\pi}{\tau(2n)}}. \]

Let the centre of the circle be $O$, then for successive divisors $d_k,d_{k+1}$ the area of the triangle $Od_kd_{k+1}$ is given by the sine area formula. It follows that the area of $P$, $|G|$, is given by the sum 
\begin{flalign}
  |G| &= \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \frac{1}{2}r^2 \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi(d_{k+1}-d_k)}{2n} \right) \label{eqn:series5}
\end{flalign}
where $m=\tau(2n)$, $1=d_1<d_2<...<d_m=2n$ are the divisors of $2n$, $d_0=0$, and $r=1$ is the radius of the circle. Notice that $d_{m-1}=n$, so the argument of $\sin$  in the last term in the sequence at \eqref{eqn:series5} is $\frac{2 \pi (2n - n)}{2n}= \pi $. Thus for all $d_k<d_{m-1}$ we have that $\frac{2 \pi (d_{k+1} - d_k)}{2n} \le \pi$. We know that the sine function is concave on this interval and so we apply Jensen's Inequality to find an upper bound, but first we notice that $\sin(\pi)=0 = \sin(0)$ so we replace the final term in \eqref{eqn:series5} with $\frac{1}{2}r^2\sin(0)$.
\begin{flalign*}
  |G| &= \sum_{k=0}^{m-2} \frac{1}{2}r^2 \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi(d_{k+1}-d_k)}{2n} \right) + \frac{1}{2}r^2 \sin(0) \\
  |G| &< m \left(\frac{1}{2}r^2 \sin \left( \frac{1}{m} \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m-2}\frac{2\pi(d_{k+1} - d_k)}{2n} +0 \right)  \right)  \right)\\
\end{flalign*}
The right hand side contains a telescoping series and thus simplifies to 

\begin{flalign*}
  |G| &< \frac{m}{2}r^2 \sin \left( \frac{\pi\left( d_{m-1} - d_0 \right) }{n} \right) =\frac{\tau(2n)}{2}\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{\tau(2n)} \right) 
\end{flalign*}

As required. For the left hand side we notice that $2=d_2$ and $n=d_{m-1}$ are both divisors of $2n$ and thus the triangle $d_0d_2d_{m-1}$ is wholly contained within $P$. Moreover $1=d_1 | 2n$ and so the area is a strict lower bound. The sine area formula yields its area as 
\begin{flalign*}
  |G|>|\triangle d_0d_2d_{m-1}| &= \frac{1}{2} r^2 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2n} (2-0) \right) + \frac{1}{2}r^2 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2n}(n-2) \right)   \\ 
  &= \frac{1}{2} \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{n}  \right) + \frac{1}{2} \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2}-\frac{\pi}{n} \right)   \\ 
  &= \frac{1}{2} \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{n}  \right) + \frac{1}{2} \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{n} \right)
\end{flalign*}





\item % Dutch BxMO TST 2018 Q4, N
Do there exist a positive integer $k$ and a nonconstant sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3, \dotsc$ of positive integers such that for each positive integer $n$,
\[ a_n = \gcd(a_{n+k},a_{n+k+1})? \]

\textit{Solution}:

Such a $k$ and a sequence do not exist. We prove this by contradiction, so suppose they do exist. Note that $a_n | a_{n+k}$ and $a_n | a_{n+k+1}$ for all $n \ge 1$. Using simple induction, it follows that $a_n | a_{n+\ell k}$ and $a_n | a_{n+\ell k+ \ell}$ for all $\ell \ge 0$. We will prove by induction to $m$ that $ a_n | a_{n+mk+(m+1)}$ for all $- \le m \le k - 1$. For $m = k - 1$, this follows from $a_n | a_{n+k_k} =a_{n+(k-1)k+k}$. Now suppose that for a certain $m$ with $1 \le m \le k - 1$ we have that $a_n | a_{n+mk+(m+1)}$. We also know that $a_n | a_{n+mk+m}$. Therefore, as $a_{n+(m-1)k+m} = \gcd(a_{n+mk+m}, a_{n+mk+m+1})$, we also have $a_n | a_{n+(m-1)k+m}$. This finishes the induction argument. Substituting $m = 0$ yields $a_n | a_{n+1}$. Because $a_n | a_{n+1}$, we also have $\gcd(a_n, a_{n+1}) = a_n$ for all $n$. Hence, $a_n = a_{n-k}$ for all $n \ge k + 1$. Now we have $a_{n-k} | a_{n-k+1} | a_{n-k+2} | . . . |a_n = a_{n-k}$. Because these are all positive integers, $a_{n-k}, a_{n-k+1}, . . . , a_n$ must all be equal. This must be true for all $n \ge k + 1$, hence the sequence is constant, which gives a contradiction.
