Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be positive real numbers such that $b, c \in [1,2)$ and
\[ \frac{a+b}{b(1+c)} +\frac{a+c}{c(1+b)} = 2. \]
Show that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of the sides of a triangle. 
}

\textit{Solution}:
By multiplying out and simplifying the given equation, we get that $a = bc$.
Thus $a + b > a = bc \geq c$, and similarly $a+c > b$.
Finally,
\[ b+c > a = bc \iff 1 > 1 -b -c +bc = (1-b)(1-c), \]
which is true since $0 \leq b-1, c-1 < 1$.

You have $22$ points on a plane such that the perimeter of the triangle formed by any three of these points is at most $2$. Is it possible to cover all of the points in the plane with a strip of width $2\sqrt{2} - 2$?

Find the least positive integer $k$ such that $2050^{2051}$ can be written as a sum of $k$ $5$th powers.
}

\textit{Solution}:
By Fermat's Little Theorem: 
$$a^{10} \equiv _{11} 1 \; \forall a \in \mathbb{Z} \ \text{such that}\ \gcd(a, 11) = 1$$ 
$$\implies (a^5)^2 \equiv _{11} 1$$
$$\implies 11 \mid (a^5)^2 - 1$$
$$\implies 11 \mid (a^5 - 1)(a^5 + 1)$$
Since $11$ is prime, we must have $11 \mid a^5 - 1 \implies a^5 \equiv _{11} 1$ or $11 \mid a^5 + 1 \implies a^5 \equiv _{11} -1$. When $11 \mid a$, $a^5 \equiv _{11} 0$.
This shows that the only values of powers of $5$ mod $11$ are $-1$, $0$ and $1$. Notice that $2050^{2051} = (2050^{205})^{10} \times 2050 \equiv _{11} 4$ and the smallest way to express $4$ as the sum of some values from $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ is $4 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1$.
This shows that $2050^{2051}$ cannot be expressed as the sum of less than $4$ fifth powers, so $k = 4$ is a lower bound.
$$(2050^{410} \times 2)^5 + (2050^{410} \times 2)^5 + (2050^{410} \times 1)^5 + (2050^{410} \times 1)^5 = (2050^{410 \times 5}) \times (2^5 + 2^5 + 1^5 + 1^5) = 2050^{2051}$$
This shows that $k = 4$ is possible, so $k = 4$ is the minimum.


\item[4.] % The Andrew, G
{\itshape
Consider an acute triangle $ABC$ with circumcircle $\Gamma$.
Let the tangents to $\Gamma$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at a point $T$, the line $TA$ intersect $\Gamma$ again at $D$, and the point diametrically opposite $D$ with respect to $\Gamma$ be $E$.
Show that the angle bisector of $\angle BEC$ intersects $AT$ on a circle which is tangent to $BT$, $CT$, and $\Gamma$.

\item[5.] % PEN M1, N
{\itshape
Let $P$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients, and define a sequence $(a_n)$ by $a_0 = 0$ and $a_{n+1} = P(a_n)$ for $n \geq 0$.
Show that for nonnegative integers $m$ and $n$,
\[ \gcd(a_m,a_n) = a_{\gcd(m,n)}. \]
}

\textit{Solution}:
Let $P^k$ denote the polynomial obtained by iterating $P$ $k$ times: $P^k(x) = \underbrace{P(P(P( \dots P(x))))}_{k \text{ times}}$. Using this notation, $a_n = P^n (0)$.
Suppose that $n \geq m$. We know that $a_m \equiv 0 \pmod{a_m}$, and so
\[
	a_n = P^{(n - m)} (a_m) \equiv P^{(n - m)} (0) \equiv a_{n - m} \pmod{a_m}.
\]
We thus have that
\[
	\gcd(a_n, a_m) = \gcd(a_{n - m}, a_m).
\]

We start with the pair $(a_n, a_m)$ and use this relationship repeatedly, always repalcing $(a_s, a_t)$ with either $(a_s, a_{t - s})$ or $(a_{s - t}, a_t)$ depending on whether $s$ or $t$ is larger. We see that the pairs of indices that appear when using this procedure are exactly the pairs of numbers that would appear if we were to use Euclid's Algorithm to calculate the GCD of $m$ and $n$. When Euclid's algorithm (for $m$ and $n$) terminates, we are left with a pair $(a_{\gcd(m, n)}, a_0)$, and so we have that
\[
	\gcd(a_m, a_n) = \gcd(a_{\gcd(m, n)}, a_0) = \gcd(a_{\gcd(m, n)}, 0) = a_{\gcd(m, n)}.
\]
