\item[1.] % Moldova 2018 8.6, A
{\itshape
Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be positive real numbers such that $b, c \in [1,2)$ and
\[ \frac{a+b}{b(1+c)} +\frac{a+c}{c(1+b)} = 2. \]
Show that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of the sides of a triangle. 
}

\textit{Solution}:


\item[2.] % The Emile, C
{\itshape
You have $22$ points on a plane such that the perimeter of the triangle formed by any three of these points is at most $2$. Is it possible to cover all of the points in the plane with a strip of width $2\sqrt{2} - 2$?

\item[3.] % the Phil, N
{\itshape
Find the least positive integer $k$ such that $2050^{2051}$ can be written as a sum of $k$ $5$th powers.
}

\textit{Solution}:


\item[4.] % The Andrew, G
{\itshape
Consider an acute triangle $ABC$ with circumcircle $\Gamma$.
Let the tangents to $\Gamma$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at a point $T$, the line $TA$ intersect $\Gamma$ again at $D$, and the point diametrically opposite $D$ with respect to $\Gamma$ be $E$.
Show that the angle bisector of $\angle BEC$ intersects $AT$ on a circle which is tangent to $BT$, $CT$, and $\Gamma$.

\textit{Solution}:


\item[5.] % PEN M1, N
{\itshape
Let $P$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients, and define a sequence $(a_n)$ by $a_0 = 0$ and $a_{n+1} = P(a_n)$ for $n \geq 0$.
Show that for nonnegative integers $m$ and $n$,
\[ \gcd(a_m,a_n) = a_{\gcd(m,n)}. \]
