\item % Spanish MO Q1, C
{\itshape
A set $T$ of integers is called \emph{broken} if there are integers $a < b < c$ such that $a$ and $c$ are in $T$ but $b$ is not in $T$.

Find the number of broken subsets of $\{1, 2, \dotsc, 2019\}$.}

\textit{Solution}: Problem solution


\item % Venezuela K11 Q4, G
{\itshape
Let $ABC$ denote an equilateral triangle.
Let $M$ and $N$ denote the midpoints of $AB$ and $BC$, respectively.
Let $P$ be a point outside $ABC$ such that $APC$ is isosceles and right-angled at $P$.
Lines $PM$ and $AN$ meet at $I$.
Prove that $CI$ is the angle bisector of $\angle ACM$.}

\textit{Solution:}
Since $\triangle BAN \equiv \triangle CAN$ we have $\angle IAB = \angle NAB = \angle CAN = \angle CAI $, and thus $AI$ is an angle bisector of $\angle CAM$. Note that $\triangle AMC \equiv \triangle BMC$ we have $\angle AMC = \angle BMC$ and $\angle AMC + \angle BMC =180^\circ$, thus $\angle AMC = \angle BMC = 90^\circ$. Since $\angle AMC + \angle CPA = 90^\circ +90^\circ =180^\circ$ we have that $AMCP$ is a cyclic quadrilateral. So $\angle AMI = \angle AMP = \angle ACP = \angle CAP = \angle CMP = \angle CMI$. Therefore $MI$ is a bisector of $\angle AMC$. This implies that $I$ is the incentre of $\triangle AMC$ and so $CI$ is the angle bisector of $\angle ACM$ by necessity.


\item % British MO 2013-2014, N
{\itshape
A number written in base $10$ is a string of $3^{2019}$ digit $3$s.
No other digit appears.
Find the highest power of $3$ which divides this number.}

\item % Irish 2018 Q7, C
{\itshape
There are $6$ eagles, $17$ snakes and $55$ mice in Wonderland.
An eagle can eat a snake or a mouse, but not another eagle.
A snake can eat a mouse, but not an eagle or another snake.
A mouse cannot eat an eagle, a snake or another mouse.

Whenever an eagle eats a snake, it turns into a mouse, and when it eats a mouse it turns into a snake. When a snake eats a mouse, it turns into an eagle.

After some time a situation is reached in which no animal can eat another animal.
What is the maximal possible number of animals alive in this situation?}

\[ a^n = a+1, \qquad b^{2n} = b+3a \]
is larger.}
