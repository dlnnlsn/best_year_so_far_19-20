\textit{Prove that for any natural number $n$, $n^5-5n^3+4n$ is divisible by $120$. }

\textit{Solution}:
\begin{align*}
  n^5 - 5n^3 + 4n &= n(n^4 - 5n^2 + 4) \\
  &= n(n^2 - 1)(n^2 - 4) \\
  &= n(n - 1)(n + 1)(n - 2)(n + 2) \\
  &= (n - 2)(n - 1)n(n + 1)(n + 2)
\end{align*}
Therefore, the original expression can be written as the product of $5$ consecutive integers. Notice that amongst any $5$ consecutive integers, one of them must be a multiple of $5$, at least one must be a multiple of $4$, at least one must be a multiple of $3$ and there must be at least one that is divisible by $2$, but not $4$.
Therefore, the product of any $5$ consecutive integers is divisible by $5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 = 120$. This means that $n^5 - 5n^3 + 4n$ is divisible by $120$.

\textit{Four pair of socks are hung out side by side on a straight washing line.
The socks in each pair are identical but the pair themselves are different colours.
How many different colour patterns can be made if no sock is allowed to be next to its matching pair?

\textit{
Find the positive integer solutions to the equation
\[ \floorsqrt{8n+1} +\floorsqrt{8n+2} +\dotsb +\floorsqrt{8n+7} = 2027. \]}

\textit{Solution}:
Notice that for $n > 1$, $\floorsqrt{8n + 1}$ and $\floorsqrt{8n + 7}$ differ by at most $1$. This means that all values $\floorsqrt{8n + 1}$, $\floorsqrt{8n + 2}$, $\dots$, $\floorsqrt{8n + 7}$ are either the same or differ by 1. Suppose that there are $a$ values that differ by $1$ and let $\floorsqrt{8n + 1} = k$.
$$7k + a = 2027$$
Notice that $2027 \equiv _7 4 \implies a = 4 \implies k = 289$ From this, we see that $\floorsqrt{8n + 1} = 289$ and specifically $\sqrt{8n + 4} = 290 \implies 8n + 4 = 290^2$. However, $8n + 4 \equiv _8 4$ and $290^2 \equiv _8 0$, so no such $n$ exists.

\textit{
Let $x_0, x_1,..., x_n$ be real numbers and define
\[y_k=x_k-x_{n-k}, \quad k=0,1,...,n.\]
Prove that 
\[y_0^2 + y_1^2+...+ y_n^2 \leq 4(x_0^2 + x_1^2 + ... + x_n^2) \]
and determine when equality holds.
}

\textit{Solution}: 
Substitute the definition of all $y_i$ into the inequality:
\begin{align*}
  &&\sum_{i = 0}^{n}y_i^2 &\leq 4\sum_{i = 0}^{n}x_i^2 &\\
  &\iff& \sum_{i = 0}^{n}(x_i - x_{n - i})^2 &\leq 4\sum_{i = 0}^{n}x_i^2 &\\
  &\iff& 2\sum_{i = 0}^{n}x_i^2 - 2\sum_{i = 0}^{n}x_ix_{n - i} &\leq 4\sum_{i = 0}^{n}x_i^2& \\
  &\iff& 0 &\leq 2\sum_{i = 0}^{n}x_i^2 + 2\sum_{i = 0}^{n}x_ix_{n - i} \\
  &\iff& 0 &\leq \sum_{i = 0}^{n}(x_i + x_{n - i})^2 &
\end{align*}

Since the square of a real number is always non-negative, the sum on the right must also be non-negative. Equality only holds when
$$x_i + x_{n - i} = 0$$
for all choices of $i$ with $0 \le i \le n$.
