\item %Standard
\textit{If $x + \frac{1}{x} = 3$, what is the value of $x^5 + \frac{1}{x^5}$?}

\textit{Solution}: Problem solution



\item %Standard
\textit{Given a triangle $ABC$ and two points $M$ and $N$ on sides $AB$ and $AC$ respectively. Let $BN$ and $CM$ intersect at $P$. It is given that the areas of $\triangle CPN$, $\triangle BPM$ and $\triangle BPC$ are $4$, $6$ and $5$ respectively.
Find the area of $\triangle ABC$.\\
(Bonus: if you would like an extra mark, use the areas 20, 19, 2019 instead)}

\textit{Solution}: Problem solution



\item %Switzerland Preliminary 2011
\textit{Find all positive integers $n$ where the product of the positive factors of $n$ is $n^3$.}

\textit{Solution}: Problem solution



\item %Spanish MO Q1
\textit{A set $T$ of integers is called \textit{broken} if there are integers $a < b < c$ such that $a$ and $c$ are in $T$, but $b$ is not in $T$.\\
Find the number of broken subsets of $\{1, 2, \dots, 2019\}$.}

\textit{Solution}: Problem solution



\item %Venezuela Final Round Q4
\textit{Let $ABC$ denote an equilateral triangle. Let $M$ and $N$ denote the midpoints of $AB$ and $BC$, respectively.
Let $P$ be a point outside $ABC$ such that $APC$ is isosceles and right-angled at $P$. Lines $PM$ and $AN$ meet at $I$.
Prove that $CI$ is the angle bisector of $\angle ACM$.}
