		\item % Emile, C
		Emile and Emma play a game on a $2019 \times 2019$ board made up of unit grid squares. Emma plays first by placing a knight on one of the squares and thereafter they take turns to place a knight on a square that does not already contain a knight and is not attacked by one of the already placed knights. The first player who cannot do this loses. Can one of the players always guarantee that they will win? If so, which one?

		\item % Moldova 2018 8.6, A
		Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be positive real numbers such that $b, c \in [1,2)$ and
		\[ \frac{a+b}{b(1+c)} +\frac{a+c}{c(1+b)} = 2. \]
		Show that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of the sides of a triangle.
